<h1> Do YOU need a place to sell and buy MMORPG-art? </h1>
<form>
<input class="button" type="button" name="" value="YES">
<input class="button" type="button" name="" value="NO">
</form>

<p> We want to make it more safe for you as an artist to sell YOUR work, and help
other people getting art of their MMORPG-characters. BUT also make it safe for the buyers.
We started off looking for a safe place to buy MMORPG-art. That's when we found out -
<p style= "font-weight: bold;">THERE IS NO SAFE PLACE TO BUY AND SELL MMORPG-ART?! </p></p>

<h4>Lock-box system</h4>
<p> We've made a system called lockbox. This system secures your money plus your artwork.
This way you won't get scammed by other users. When you, as an artist upload your art,
it will get an overlay that makes it harder to scam.
Our system secures a payment for your work before the work gets to the buyer.
Everything on our page is preuploaded, so you get what you see.
<img class="model" src= "img/model.png" alt= "model"/>
<br> <br>On our website you can pay with PayPal or credit cards. This makes is easier
for you as a buyer, to get the art that you want. <br></p>

<h4>Commissions</h4>
<p>It's possible to buy both pre-drawn art or you can make a commission. <br>
If you make a commission you can choose whoever you want, to draw your character
Another solution is to make the commission request personally to the artist on their own profile. <br>
Firstly the lockbox system shows the art with a watermark layer;
this prevents the buyer from stealing the image beforehand.<br>
When both seller and buyer have accepted the deal, the buyer will get the art without the watermark,
and the seller will get the money.</p>

<h4>Categories</h4>
<p>On our website there will be a shop page and a commission page, where there will be categories,
and buyers can request art of their characters.
The categories will be selected from the artists' uploads. Any artist can request making a
new category as soon as they upload a new drawing.
When you upload art, you can also choose from the previous categories.</p>

<h4>Forums</h4>
<p>Our website is going to contain forums as well. These forums makes it easier to get new connections,
and make a community. You can get new friends and talk about everything you want.
This way, you can also get inspiration from one another.</p>

<p>We'll have admins taking care of problems. They'll keep an eye on the forums aswell.
This will also give you, as a user, a feeling of security overall.</p>

<h4>Accounts</h4>
<p>There'll be two kinds of users - artists and buyers. The artists get a profile
where they for example can make a portfolio, so the other users can see previous works
even through they aren't for sale. </p>

<p>
  As a user you can have two kinds of folder - for sale and portfolio.
</p>

<h4>About us</h4>
<p> We are a team of dedicated people, who have had unfortunate encounters with scammers.
  This business is built on what we think sale of MMORPG- art should be, and how we think is the best way for both our artist and customers.
  We design our system on the principle of security. We want to give you the best experience possible.
